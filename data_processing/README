Make_dicts and make_new_dicts should be combined at some time in the future.
1. `make_dicts.py' takes in a manifest file (with relative directories) and compiles them into a python pickled dict (full_dict.pkl).
2. `make_new_dicts.py' takes an updates the older dict (full_dict.pkl) with a newer dataset that Kyle gave into `new_dict.pkl'.  TODO: Combine these two steps
3. `make_splits_from_dicts.py' creates the train, dev, and test splits.
4. `make_datafiles_from_dicts' processes these splits into the context that they're supposed to give. Needs both the splits and pkls.
